RJ-PINNs, introduced by Dadoyi Dadesso, is a pioneering framework using Jacobian-based least-squares (TRF) to directly minimize residuals without traditional loss functions. This method is the first to eliminate gradient optimizers in PINNs, offering unmatched robustness for inverse PDE problems.

For more information, please refer to the following:https://github.com/dadesso17/RJ-PINNs/ or preprint: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15138086

## Features
- **Jacobian-based least-squares (TRF)**: Directly minimize residuals without traditional loss functions.
- **No Gradient Optimizers**: Eliminate the need for gradient optimizers in PINNs.
- **Robustness for Inverse PDE Problems**: Unmatched robustness for solving inverse partial differential equations (PDE) problems.

## Key Differences

| Aspect         | Traditional PINNs                         | RJ-PINNs                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Objective** | Minimize a loss function L(θ) | Minimize the residuals R(θ) |
| **Gradient** | Compute ∇L(θ) | Compute ∇R(θ) |
| **Optimization** | Use gradient-based optimizers (e.g., Adam, L-BFGS) | Use least-squares optimizer (e.g., TRF) |
| **Implementation** | Define a loss function and its gradient | Define residuals and their Jacobian |
| **Convergence** | Not guaranteed | Robust convergence |

## ⚠️ Important: Practical Notes for Using RJ-PINNs

> **RJ-PINNs** (Residual Jacobian Physics-Informed Neural Networks) offer better convergence and stability than traditional PINNs — but some practical issues can still arise.


- 🧠 **Alternative strategies:**
  - Use **adaptive weighting techniques** or **normalization strategies** (as in traditional PINNs) to improve stability.

> 🧩 **Note:** This issue is common in the general PINN framework — it's **not specific to RJ-PINNs**.
